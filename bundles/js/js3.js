        SPAPP_HBS_BTC_OUTLINE_VALUE: "Bitcoin is a virtual currency that began as a concept described in a paper published on the Internet in 2008 by someone assuming the name Satoshi Nakamoto.Through the use of a distributed ledger known as a blockchain, Bitcoin can store and transfer values over the Internet without the need for an issuing authority or administrator. Because Bitcoin has the highest market capitalization of all the numerous virtual currencies, it is not an exaggeration to say it is the most prominent virtual currency. There are many currencies that split off from or are derived from Bitcoin, and it is the cornerstone of virtual currencies. ",
        SPAPP_HBS_ETH_OUTLINE_TITLE: "About Ethereum",
        SPAPP_HBS_ETH_OUTLINE_VALUE: "Ethereum is a platform developed by Vitalik Buterin. The platform also contains a virtual currency called Ether (ETH). The platform and the virtual currency are both commonly referred to as Ethereum. Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum uses mining and issues currency through Proof of Work (PoW). However, there is a possibility of a transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) in the future where the difficulty of mining is adjusted based on the amount and time of currency held by miners (as of September 10, 2019).",
        SPAPP_HBS_ETC_OUTLINE_TITLE: "About Ethereum Classic",
        SPAPP_HBS_ETC_OUTLINE_VALUE: "Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a platform for building distributed applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic adopted Proof of Work (PoW) as its consensus mechanism, which builds a consensus as a community. Ethereum Classic is functionally the same as Ethereum, but the issuance cap and reduction periods are different. Specifically, the issuance cap is set at approximately 210 million and the mining rewards are decreased by 20% every 5 million blocks (as of October 2019). While Bitcoin takes about 10 minutes to mine a block, Ethereum Classic takes about 15 seconds. The smallest unit of ETC is the Wei, which is 0.000000000000000001 ETC.",

        SPAPP_HBS_LTC_OUTLINE_VALUE: "Litecoin (unit: LTC) is a virtual currency created by former Google engineer, Charlie Lee, and was launched in October 2011. The market capitalization of Litecoin as of July 2019 was about 5.5 billion USD (approx. 600 billion JPY). Since 2014, the top ranked altcoins have been constantly changing places with each other as more came flooding in. However, Litecoin has been said to have achieved a comparatively stable growth.",
        SPAPP_HBS_BCH_OUTLINE_TITLE: "About Bitcoin Cash",
        SPAPP_HBS_BCH_OUTLINE_VALUE: "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a virtual currency which launched in August 2017, created from a hard fork of Bitcoin (BTC).  The rapid increase in demand for Bitcoin in 2017 led to a decrease in processing speed and a significant increase in transaction fees. Sensing that a crisis was on the horizon, a community was formed with the intent of developing Bitcoin Cash. A hard fork usually refers to an update to the validation rules for a blockchain protocol. If there is a sufficient amount of dissent from developers, the community may split off into separate currencies. ",

The beta version of Monacoin was released in December 2013. Full-scale operation started after the launch of the official version in January 2014. The name of Monacoin is derived from a popular character on 2channel called Mona. Nowadays it has gained huge popularity as a virtual currency used in subcultures in Tokyo and Akihabara.",

        SPAPP_HBS_LSK_OUTLINE_VALUE: "Lisk is a platform for building distributed applications developed by Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows. The virtual currency (LSK) used within the platform is also called Lisk. Decentralized applications (DApps) are applications that can run without a central administrator such as a company or bank. DApps allow all participants in the application to manage data in a distributed format and participate in decision-making such as specification changes. The processing time for Lisk is about 10 seconds, which makes remittances very fast. There is no issuance cap set for Lisk, but the amount to be issued decreases every 3 million blocks.",
        SPAPP_HBS_XRP_OUTLINE_TITLE: "About Ripple",
        SPAPP_HBS_XRP_OUTLINE_VALUE: "Ripple (XRP) is a cryptocurrency that uses RippleNet, an international remittance solution for financial institutions created by Ripple, a technology company. The issuance cap is set to 100 billion XRP, all of which has been issued. Therefore, it does not have a traditional mining system for issuing coins like Bitcoin. RippleNet is based on Interledger Protocol (ILP), a technology that makes it possible to connect multiple blockchains and payment networks, and is focused on on-demand liquidity (ODL, formerly xRapid). For example, one could make an international remittance by converting JPY to XRP, immediately send it to its destination on the unique XRP Ledger blockchain, then convert the XRP to the currency of the destination country. To put it simply, XRP acts as a bridge between different currencies. It is said that banks and payment service providers participating in RippleNet can make international remittances in about 3.6 seconds with a transaction fee of about $0.001 USD. It is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is said to be able to process 1,500 transactions per second. The unique consensus algorithm, XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol (XRP LCP), contributes to these high-speed transfers. In XRP LCP, there is a validator that authorizes transactions. If it is deemed valid, it is considered to have achieved consensus. It can achieve high-speed processing because it does not require complicated calculations like mining.",

It has a system for anonymously measuring user interest and paying publishers the appropriate rewards. Users who see ads in Brave can gain BAT point rewards, which they can send to the creators and websites they like. Brave was released in November 2019, and as of November 2019, has over 10 million monthly active users. *We endeavor to provide accurate information on this page.

The goal of NEM is to establish a new economic framework based on the principles of decentralization, economic freedom, and equality, rather than the existing frameworks managed by countries and governments. NEM uses a special consensus algorithm called Proof of Importance (PoI) which is designed to make it easier to reward people who contribute to the community. Through PoI, the time to approve each block is about 1 minute. This is because it does not require computers to perform advanced calculations as seen in Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms.",
